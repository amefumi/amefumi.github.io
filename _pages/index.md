I speak Chinese, English, and Japanese.

# Mottos
1. Observe the observable, control the controlable, and leave the rest alone.
2. [RFC 1925: The Twelve Networking Truths](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1925.txt)
3. Douglas Adams's three rules of technologies:
    1. Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
    2. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
    3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.
