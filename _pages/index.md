I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), under the supervision of [Prof. Yujun Zhang](http://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496789.html) ([English](https://www-ict-ac-cn.translate.goog/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496789.html?_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=zh-CN)). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University in June 2022. My bachelor's thesis is under the supervision of [Prof. Tao Zhang](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1081/3196.htm) ([English](https://www-au-tsinghua-edu-cn.translate.goog/info/1081/3196.htm?_x_tr_sl=zh-CN&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=zh-CN))

I speak Chinese, English, and Japanese.

# Mottos
1. Observe the observable, control the controlable, and leave the rest alone.
2. [RFC 1925: The Twelve Networking Truths](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1925.txt)
3. Douglas Adams's three rules of technologies:
    1. Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
    2. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
    3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.
