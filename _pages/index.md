I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), under the supervision of [Prof. Yujun Zhang](http://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496789.html) ([English](https://www-ict-ac-cn.translate.goog/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496789.html?_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=zh-CN&_x_tr_pto=wapp)). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University in June 2022.

# Research Interests
My research is primarily focused on computer networks. I am particularly interested in exploring the following areas:
- Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)
- Datacenter Networks (DCN)
- Programmable Network and Software Defined Network
